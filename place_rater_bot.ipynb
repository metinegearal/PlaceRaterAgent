    "This project's main focus creating a rating agent that finds good places to eat in the nearby location to some reference point. Unlike simple rates from Google Maps, this app searches a variety of sites and gives you specific rates for not only restaurant features but also for some specific dishes. This can be especially beneficial for tourists who can't find where to eat. You can do it by giving it a place name or coordinates as a reference.\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants a summary of comments about *specific food/drink items* mentioned in reviews for \\\"Silivri Kale Park\\\" in Silivri, Turkey. The output should include:\n",
    "    *   Detailed comments/observations about each specific item found.\n",
    "    *   A concise summary section in the format `Item: Sentiment (Reasons)`.\n",
    "    *   The sentiment scale allows for ranges (e.g., average-good, good-excellent).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Identify the Location:** Silivri Kale Park, Silivri, Turkey. The provided Google Maps link confirms this.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Determine Search Strategy:**\n",
    "    *   The key is finding *specific* food/drink mentions within reviews for this *specific* place.\n",
    "    *   Google Maps reviews are the primary target, but direct access is limited. Use web search to find review snippets, review site summaries, travel blogs, or articles mentioning the park's cafes/restaurants and their offerings.\n",
    "    *   Initial search queries should target reviews and specific food items common in Turkish cafes/parks.\n",
    "    *   Keywords: \\\"Silivri Kale Park reviews\\\", \\\"Silivri Kale Park cafe menu\\\", \\\"Silivri Kale Park kahvaltı yorumlar\\\" (breakfast reviews), \\\"Silivri Kale Park çay kahve yorumlar\\\" (tea coffee reviews), \\\"Silivri Kale Park yemek yorumları\\\" (food reviews), \\\"Silivri Kale Park manzara cafe\\\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Formulate Search Queries (Internal thought):**\n",
    "    *   *Question format:* \\\"What do reviews say about the food at Silivri Kale Park Cafe?\\\", \\\"Reviews of tea and coffee at Silivri Kale Park?\\\", \\\"Is the breakfast good at Silivri Kale Park?\\\"\n",
    "    *   *Keyword format:* \\\"Silivri Kale Park cafe reviews\\\", \\\"Silivri Kale Park breakfast reviews\\\", \\\"Silivri Kale Park tea coffee comments\\\", \\\"Silivri Kale Park menu prices\\\", \\\"Silivri Kale Park manzara cafe yorum\\\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Execute Search (Simulated):** Run the search queries.\n",
    "    6.  **Analyze Search Results:**\n",
    "    *   **Source 2 & 8:** Mention tea (çay) price (1 TL in 2023, 2024) and Americano price (11 TL in 2023) and sweets (tatlılar) (20-30 TL range in 2023). Calls Americano performance \\\"outstanding\\\". Mentions enjoying tea/coffee overlooking the \\\"Bosphorus\\\" (likely a mistake, should be Marmara Sea). States breakfast plate (kahvaltı tabağı) is relatively expensive compared to its content, despite other very low prices. General comment is \\\"best value for money\\\".\n",
    "    *   **Source 3 & 4:** Mention tea (çay) at 1 TL and coffee (kahve) at 3 TL (prices from 2020). Calls prices \\\"very uygun\\\" (very suitable/affordable). Focuses on the park's renovation and how nice it is now compared to before. Mentions a closed cafeteria (kapalı kafeterya) was built.\n",
    "    *   **Source 5:** Mentions menu items from a 2020 council meeting setting prices: Kale Tost (Kaşarlı/Cheese: 10 TL, Sucuklu/Sausage: 12 TL, Karışık/Mixed: 12 TL), Espresso (6 TL), Espresso Doble (8 TL), Americano (8 TL), Cafe Latte (8 TL), Cappuccino (8 TL). Also states a general rule: sell food items at 75% above cost.\n",
    "    *   **Source 7 & 9:** Describes it as a family-friendly restaurant with reasonable prices. Mentions delicious food for breakfast, lunch, dinner, late-night snacks. One reviewer says food and service need work (\\\"müssen noch am Essen und am Service arbeiten\\\"). Another mentions the menu could be more varied (\\\"menü daha çeşitli olabilir\\\") but thinks people go for the view, not the menu diversity.\n",
    "    *   **Source 8 & 10 & 11:** TikTok videos reiterate very low prices for tea (1 TL) and coffee (5 TL) (as of May 2024 or Aug 2023). Call sweets and food (yiyecekler) also very affordable. Mention you can bring your own food for a picnic. One comment on a 2023 TikTok video (dated Aug 2024) disputes the low prices, saying they are now normal like outside (\\\"değil daha yeni gittim herşeyin fiyatı normal disardikiler gibi olmuş\\\").\n",
    "    *   **Source 12:** Complaint website (Şikayetvar). One review from Feb 2023 mentions arriving for breakfast (kahvaltı), finding the breakfast plate unavailable (\\\"Kahvaltı tabağı yoktu\\\"), and ordering toast (tost), fries (patates), and tea (çay) instead. Another complaint from July 2024 mentions slow service (\\\"garsonlar... müşteriye çok geç bakıyorlar. Siparişler de geç geliyor\\\"). Another from April 2023 mentions going to get fries (patates).\n",
    "    *   **Source 13:** Review site snippets. Mentions breakfast (kahvaltı) again, noting the place was closed at 8:30 AM despite an 8:00 AM opening time. Another praises the view and reasonable prices (\\\"Fiyatlar müsait, manzarası mükemmel\\\"). Calls it a \\\"Coffee\\\" type restaurant.\n",
    "    *   **Source 6, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21:** General park info, other cafes, unrelated content, menus for different places, or don't contain specific food reviews for *this* location. (Source 6 is a menu for Silivrikapı Park Cafe in Fatih, not Silivri Kale Park. Source 18 is for Kale Cafe & Restaurant, likely a different place).\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Synthesize Findings for Specific Items:**\n",
    "    *   **Tea (Çay):** Consistently mentioned for its extremely low price (1 TL in 2020, 2023, May 2024). Generally seen very positively due to the price and the pleasant experience of drinking it with the view. One recent comment (Aug 2024) claims prices are now normal, casting doubt on the continued 1 TL price.\n",
    "    *   **Coffee (Kahve - general):** Also noted for very low prices (3 TL in 2020, 5 TL in 2023/May 2024). Similar positive sentiment due to price and view. Subject to the same recent comment about price increases.\n",
    "    *   **Americano:** Specifically mentioned once (July 2023) as having \\\"outstanding\\\" performance despite a low price (11 TL at that time, compared to 8 TL set in 2020).\n",
    "    *   **Espresso / Latte / Cappuccino:** Prices set in 2020 (6-8 TL), but no specific quality comments found. Assumed to be covered by the general low price comments for \\\"coffee\\\".\n",
    "    *   **Breakfast (Kahvaltı / Kahvaltı Tabağı):** Mixed comments. Mentioned as being available. One comment (2023) found the breakfast plate relatively expensive for its contents compared to the very cheap drinks. Another (Feb 2023) couldn't get the breakfast plate at all on a Sunday morning. Another mentions arriving for breakfast at 8:30 AM to find it still closed. Service time issues might impact breakfast experience.\n",
    "    *   **Sweets / Desserts (Tatlılar):** Mentioned as having affordable prices (20-30 TL range in July 2023, \\\"çok uygun\\\" in May 2024). No specific types or quality comments found.\n",
    "    *   **Toast (Tost):** Mentioned as being ordered when breakfast plate was unavailable. Specific types (Kaşarlı, Sucuklu, Karışık) and prices (10-12 TL) set in 2020. No quality comments found.\n",
    "    *   **Fries (Patates):** Mentioned twice as being ordered/sought after. No quality comments found.\n",
    "    *   **General Food (Yemekler / Yiyecekler):** Mentioned as being available for lunch/dinner/snacks and generally \\\"delicious\\\" and \\\"affordable\\\" (May 2024). However, one reviewer (in German) suggested food needs improvement. Another noted the menu might lack variety.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  **Structure the Response:**\n",
    "    *   Start with an introductory sentence.\n",
    "    *   Create a \\\"Detailed Comments\\\" section, listing each item found and summarizing the relevant points from the analysis above.\n",
    "    *   Create a \\\"Summary\\\" section using the user's requested format: `Item: Sentiment (Reasons)`. Assign sentiment based on the overall tone of comments (considering price, quality mentions, availability issues). Use ranges where appropriate.\n",
    "    *   Add a concluding remark about the overall focus (view, prices) vs. specific food quality based on findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.  **Refine Sentiment Ratings:**\n",
    "    *   Tea/Coffee: Excellent (primarily due to extremely low price point combined with view). Add a note about potential price changes.\n",
    "    *   Americano: Good-Excellent (specific positive mention of quality + low price).\n",
    "    *   Breakfast: Acceptable-Average (mentions of being relatively expensive, unavailable, or service time issues temper general availability).\n",
    "    *   Sweets/Toast/Fries: Average (mentioned as available and affordable, but no specific praise for quality found).\n",
    "    *   General Food: Average-Good (comments on affordability and deliciousness balanced by comments on needing improvement and lacking variety).\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Final Review:** Check if all user requirements are met: specific items identified, detailed comments provided, summary section formatted correctly, sentiment scale used (including ranges), location is correct. Ensure the language is clear and directly addresses the user's request based *only* on the search findings.\"\"\"+\"\"\"Okay, let's look for comments about specific food and drink items at the **Silivri Kale Park** social facility/cafe in Silivri, Turkey, based on web search results.\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants a summary of comments about *specific food/drink items* mentioned in reviews for \\\"Silivri Kale Park\\\" in Silivri, Turkey. The output should include:\n",
    "    *   Detailed comments/observations about each specific item found.\n",
    "    *   A concise summary section in the format `Item: Sentiment (Reasons)`.\n",
    "    *   The sentiment scale allows for ranges (e.g., average-good, good-excellent).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Identify the Location:** Silivri Kale Park, Silivri, Turkey. The provided Google Maps link confirms this.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Determine Search Strategy:**\n",
    "    *   The key is finding *specific* food/drink mentions within reviews for this *specific* place.\n",
    "    *   Google Maps reviews are the primary target, but direct access is limited. Use web search to find review snippets, review site summaries, travel blogs, or articles mentioning the park's cafes/restaurants and their offerings.\n",
    "    *   Initial search queries should target reviews and specific food items common in Turkish cafes/parks.\n",
    "    *   Keywords: \\\"Silivri Kale Park reviews\\\", \\\"Silivri Kale Park cafe menu\\\", \\\"Silivri Kale Park kahvaltı yorumlar\\\" (breakfast reviews), \\\"Silivri Kale Park çay kahve yorumlar\\\" (tea coffee reviews), \\\"Silivri Kale Park yemek yorumları\\\" (food reviews), \\\"Silivri Kale Park manzara cafe\\\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Formulate Search Queries (Internal thought):**\n",
    "    *   *Question format:* \\\"What do reviews say about the food at Silivri Kale Park Cafe?\\\", \\\"Reviews of tea and coffee at Silivri Kale Park?\\\", \\\"Is the breakfast good at Silivri Kale Park?\\\"\n",
    "    *   *Keyword format:* \\\"Silivri Kale Park cafe reviews\\\", \\\"Silivri Kale Park breakfast reviews\\\", \\\"Silivri Kale Park tea coffee comments\\\", \\\"Silivri Kale Park menu prices\\\", \\\"Silivri Kale Park manzara cafe yorum\\\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Execute Search (Simulated):** Run the search queries.\n",
    "    6.  **Analyze Search Results:**\n",
    "    *   **Source 2 & 8:** Mention tea (çay) price (1 TL in 2023, 2024) and Americano price (11 TL in 2023) and sweets (tatlılar) (20-30 TL range in 2023). Calls Americano performance \\\"outstanding\\\". Mentions enjoying tea/coffee overlooking the \\\"Bosphorus\\\" (likely a mistake, should be Marmara Sea). States breakfast plate (kahvaltı tabağı) is relatively expensive compared to its content, despite other very low prices. General comment is \\\"best value for money\\\".\n",
    "    *   **Source 3 & 4:** Mention tea (çay) at 1 TL and coffee (kahve) at 3 TL (prices from 2020). Calls prices \\\"very uygun\\\" (very suitable/affordable). Focuses on the park's renovation and how nice it is now compared to before. Mentions a closed cafeteria (kapalı kafeterya) was built.\n",
    "    *   **Source 5:** Mentions menu items from a 2020 council meeting setting prices: Kale Tost (Kaşarlı/Cheese: 10 TL, Sucuklu/Sausage: 12 TL, Karışık/Mixed: 12 TL), Espresso (6 TL), Espresso Doble (8 TL), Americano (8 TL), Cafe Latte (8 TL), Cappuccino (8 TL). Also states a general rule: sell food items at 75% above cost.\n",
    "    *   **Source 7 & 9:** Describes it as a family-friendly restaurant with reasonable prices. Mentions delicious food for breakfast, lunch, dinner, late-night snacks. One reviewer says food and service need work (\\\"müssen noch am Essen und am Service arbeiten\\\"). Another mentions the menu could be more varied (\\\"menü daha çeşitli olabilir\\\") but thinks people go for the view, not the menu diversity.\n",
    "    *   **Source 8 & 10 & 11:** TikTok videos reiterate very low prices for tea (1 TL) and coffee (5 TL) (as of May 2024 or Aug 2023). Call sweets and food (yiyecekler) also very affordable. Mention you can bring your own food for a picnic. One comment on a 2023 TikTok video (dated Aug 2024) disputes the low prices, saying they are now normal like outside (\\\"değil daha yeni gittim herşeyin fiyatı normal disardikiler gibi olmuş\\\").\n",
    "    *   **Source 12:** Complaint website (Şikayetvar). One review from Feb 2023 mentions arriving for breakfast (kahvaltı), finding the breakfast plate unavailable (\\\"Kahvaltı tabağı yoktu\\\"), and ordering toast (tost), fries (patates), and tea (çay) instead. Another complaint from July 2024 mentions slow service (\\\"garsonlar... müşteriye çok geç bakıyorlar. Siparişler de geç geliyor\\\"). Another from April 2023 mentions going to get fries (patates).\n",
    "    *   **Source 13:** Review site snippets. Mentions breakfast (kahvaltı) again, noting the place was closed at 8:30 AM despite an 8:00 AM opening time. Another praises the view and reasonable prices (\\\"Fiyatlar müsait, manzarası mükemmel\\\"). Calls it a \\\"Coffee\\\" type restaurant.\n",
    "    *   **Source 6, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21:** General park info, other cafes, unrelated content, menus for different places, or don't contain specific food reviews for *this* location. (Source 6 is a menu for Silivrikapı Park Cafe in Fatih, not Silivri Kale Park. Source 18 is for Kale Cafe & Restaurant, likely a different place).\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Synthesize Findings for Specific Items:**\n",
    "    *   **Tea (Çay):** Consistently mentioned for its extremely low price (1 TL in 2020, 2023, May 2024). Generally seen very positively due to the price and the pleasant experience of drinking it with the view. One recent comment (Aug 2024) claims prices are now normal, casting doubt on the continued 1 TL price.\n",
    "    *   **Coffee (Kahve - general):** Also noted for very low prices (3 TL in 2020, 5 TL in 2023/May 2024). Similar positive sentiment due to price and view. Subject to the same recent comment about price increases.\n",
    "    *   **Americano:** Specifically mentioned once (July 2023) as having \\\"outstanding\\\" performance despite a low price (11 TL at that time, compared to 8 TL set in 2020).\n",
    "    *   **Espresso / Latte / Cappuccino:** Prices set in 2020 (6-8 TL), but no specific quality comments found. Assumed to be covered by the general low price comments for \\\"coffee\\\".\n",
    "    *   **Breakfast (Kahvaltı / Kahvaltı Tabağı):** Mixed comments. Mentioned as being available. One comment (2023) found the breakfast plate relatively expensive for its contents compared to the very cheap drinks. Another (Feb 2023) couldn't get the breakfast plate at all on a Sunday morning. Another mentions arriving for breakfast at 8:30 AM to find it still closed. Service time issues might impact breakfast experience.\n",
    "    *   **Sweets / Desserts (Tatlılar):** Mentioned as having affordable prices (20-30 TL range in July 2023, \\\"çok uygun\\\" in May 2024). No specific types or quality comments found.\n",
    "    *   **Toast (Tost):** Mentioned as being ordered when breakfast plate was unavailable. Specific types (Kaşarlı, Sucuklu, Karışık) and prices (10-12 TL) set in 2020. No quality comments found.\n",
    "    *   **Fries (Patates):** Mentioned twice as being ordered/sought after. No quality comments found.\n",
    "    *   **General Food (Yemekler / Yiyecekler):** Mentioned as being available for lunch/dinner/snacks and generally \\\"delicious\\\" and \\\"affordable\\\" (May 2024). However, one reviewer (in German) suggested food needs improvement. Another noted the menu might lack variety.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  **Structure the Response:**\n",
    "    *   Start with an introductory sentence.\n",
    "    *   Create a \\\"Detailed Comments\\\" section, listing each item found and summarizing the relevant points from the analysis above.\n",
    "    *   Create a \\\"Summary\\\" section using the user's requested format: `Item: Sentiment (Reasons)`. Assign sentiment based on the overall tone of comments (considering price, quality mentions, availability issues). Use ranges where appropriate.\n",
    "    *   Add a concluding remark about the overall focus (view, prices) vs. specific food quality based on findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.  **Refine Sentiment Ratings:**\n",
    "    *   Tea/Coffee: Excellent (primarily due to extremely low price point combined with view). Add a note about potential price changes.\n",
    "    *   Americano: Good-Excellent (specific positive mention of quality + low price).\n",
    "    *   Breakfast: Acceptable-Average (mentions of being relatively expensive, unavailable, or service time issues temper general availability).\n",
    "    *   Sweets/Toast/Fries: Average (mentioned as available and affordable, but no specific praise for quality found).\n",
    "    *   General Food: Average-Good (comments on affordability and deliciousness balanced by comments on needing improvement and lacking variety).\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Final Review:** Check if all user requirements are met: specific items identified, detailed comments provided, summary section formatted correctly, sentiment scale used (including ranges), location is correct. Ensure the language is clear and directly addresses the user's request based *only* on the search findings.\"\"\"),\n",

    "    *   The same August 2024 comment about prices becoming \\\"normal\\\" also applies here.\n",
    "*   **Americano:**\n",
    "    *   Specifically mentioned in a July 2023 review, priced at 11 TL at that time. The reviewer described its \\\"performance\\\" (presumably taste/quality) as \\\"outstanding\\\" for the price. (Note: A price of 8 TL was set in a 2020 council decision).\n",
    "*   **Espresso / Cafe Latte / Cappuccino:**\n",
    "    *   Prices were set in a 2020 council decision (Espresso 6 TL, others 8 TL), indicating they are offered. No specific comments on their quality were found in the searched reviews, but they likely fall under the general positive sentiment for \\\"coffee\\\" due to low prices.\n",

    "*   **Sweets / Desserts (Tatlılar):**\n",
    "    *   Mentioned as having affordable prices, with one review citing a 20-30 TL range in July 2023, and another simply calling them \\\"çok uygun\\\" (very affordable) in May 2024. No specific types of sweets or quality comments were found.\n",

    "*   **Fries (Patates):**\n",

    "*   **General Food (Yiyecekler / Yemekler):**\n",
    "    *   Some reviews mention the availability of \\\"delicious food\\\" for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks at \\\"reasonable\\\" or \\\"very affordable\\\" prices.\n",
